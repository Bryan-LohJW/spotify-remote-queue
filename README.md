# Remote Queue for Spotify

This application is for users to let their friends add songs into their current queue without any hassle.
It is done by logging into Spotify and giving access to the application to send commands to your Spotify account.

## Requirements

1. Premium account, so that user is able to add songs and to control the player.
2. Whitelist from application owner (Bryan). Because Spotify has not 'approved' this application, the only accounts able to use this has to be whitelisted. If you wish to have access please contact bryanlohjw97@gmail.com.

## How to use?

After fulfilling the requirements, go onto bryanlohjw.com and click 'Log In'. Enter your details for the OAUTH authentication and you will be redirected to the search page.
Click the share icon at the top of the screen, and the link to your session will be copied to your clipboard.
Share the link with your friends and they can search for songs and add them to your queue.
